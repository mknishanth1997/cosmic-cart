**Cosmic Cart** is a satire e-commerce website where users can "purchase" planets and solar systems. The goal is creative advertisement: after a user "buys" a planet, we ask, _"How will you get there?"_ and nudge them to invest in their countryâ€™s space programs like NASA or ISRO.

Instead of a flashy landing page, we built a fully functional fake e-commerce site that engages users naturally. Whenever they think about space, theyâ€™ll remember Cosmic Cart.
